<p>In the RPP context, the route of concern is inhalation. Hazardous substances in the air can cause damage by either being embedded into the lungs or absorbed into the blood and then transported to various organs in the body. This type of exposure can quickly produce adverse effects on health.</p>

<p>Some hazardous substances can be removed naturally. However, some of them can remain in the lungs and cause severe injury which could lead to scarring.</p>

<p>Scarring decreases the elasticity of the lungs and decreases the O2 and CO2 exchange in the alveoli. In other words, if the lungs lose elasticity, they are no longer able to expand which will result in a reduced surface area for oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream. This reduced expansion will make breathing difficult or impossible, depending on the severity of scarring.</p>


<h3>Occupational Illness and Disease</h3>
<p>Occupational illness is any disease, health condition or disorder caused by exposure to environmental factors or substances associated with the work. This includes acute and chronic illnesses or diseases which can manifest immediately or latently and can result from inhalation, absorption, ingestion, or direct contact with a substance.</p>

<p>Overall, occupational illnesses can have a delayed onset, from single or chronic exposures, taking as long as 40 years to manifest their effects on the body. For this reason, it is important that all employees and military members have and are correctly using proper RPDs to protect themselves. They must also watch out for any symptoms and let their manager or supervisor know when they are experiencing symptoms, no matter how small.</p>

<p>Examples of specific illnesses and diseases resulting from improper protection include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chronic obstructive pulmonary (or lung) disease (COPD or COLD)</li>
  <li>silicosis</li>
  <li>cancers</li>
  
</ul>

    <h2>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary (or Lung) Diseases (COPD or COLD)</h2>
    <p>COPDs or COLDs are groups of diseases in which there is insufficient flow of air in or out of the lungs. COPDs include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.</p>
    <p>When the RPP is not followed, COPDs can affect the following workers:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>welders exposed to stainless steel fumes</li>
      <li>mechanics exposed to cobalt, vanadium, chromium, platinum, nickel, metal working fluids, amines</li>
      <li>boat builders exposed to toluene diisocyanate </li>
      <li>laboratory workers</li>
      <li>nurses exposed to formalin/formaldehyde, detergent, enzymes</li>
      <li>dentists and dental workers exposed to acrylates, latex</li>
      <li>aircraft fitters exposed to triethylenetetramine</li>
      <li>autobody workers exposed to acrylates (resins, glues, sealants, adhesives), metals, amines, anhydrides, acrylates, urethanes, polyvinyl chloride, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  
  <div>
    <h2>Silicosis</h2>
    <p>Silicosis is an incurable lung disease that leads to disability and death. It's caused by inhaling dust that contains free crystalline silica particles. When inhaled, these particles lead to reducing the elasticity of the lungs' surface, thereby causing shortness of breath from reduced transfer of gases.</p>
    
    <p>Crystalline silica is a common mineral found in sand, stone, concrete, and mortar. It's used to make such products as glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, and artificial stone. Workers doing abrasive blasting, cutting, sawing, demolishing, drilling, grinding, mixing, polishing, sanding, sweeping, etc. are at risk, as are those working around them.</p>
  </div>

  
  <div>
    <h2>Cancers</h2>
    <p>When the RPP is not followed, cancer can affect the following workers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>lung cancer can affect painters, refinishers, welders, firefighters, and water treatment and sewage facility workers exposed to chlorine gas</li>
      <li>bladder (urinary) cancer can affect firefighters, pipefitters, painters, and other workers exposed to aromatic amines, arsenic, coal, tars and pitches, diesel engine exhaust, etc.</li>
      <li>leukemia and/or lymphoma can affect firefighters and painters exposed to benzene, formaldehyde, etc.</li>
      <li>mesothelioma can affect mechanics, shipbuilding workers, welders, etc. from exposure to asbestos</li>
      <li>stomach cancer can affect shipyard and dockyard workers exposed to asbestos, lead compounds</li>
      <li>kidney cancer can affect welders from exposure to metal fume</li>
      <li>liver cancer can affect mechanics exposed to degreasing solvent vapours, chemicals or toxins, and groundsmen with airborne exposure to pesticides or insecticides</li>
    </ul>
