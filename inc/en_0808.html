    <h2>Fire Marshal Directives (FMDs)</h2>
    <p>FMDs are designed to explain the procedures to follow for aspects of the RPP that require more specific departmental guidance than is provided elsewhere. There are currently eight FMDs for the RPP. Two of them are intended strictly for Fire Services Personnel (bolded), while the other six generally apply to DND/CAF.</p>
    <p>The following FMDs can be found under <a href="https://collaboration-admie-smaie.forces.mil.ca/sites/Policy/ApprovedPolicy_Lib/Forms/allitem.aspx?View=%7bB7DBB95D-87CD-48D4-B94D-B24FB7833398%7d&FilterField1=Functional_x002f_L1_x0020_Area&FilterValue1=Fire/Respiratory%20Protection" target="_blank">ADM(IE)'s approved policies in SharePoint</a>.</p>

    <h2>Standing Orders</h2>
    <p>A standing order specifies the roles and responsibilities from Part 1 of the DND RPP for all local (Base/Wing/Formation) RPP stakeholders.</p>
    <p>At a minimum, the standing orders must contain information on the following roles: user, manager, supervisor, fit tester, RPPA, Preventive Medicine Technician and Health Canada's Public Service Occupational Health Program (PSOHP) General Safety Officer/Advisor and the CFFM</p>
    <p>In other words, a standing order must specify who does fit testing, who does air quality testing, who does annual walkaround inspections, who is responsible for ensuring that OHWAs and occupational health evaluations are completed, who ensures training and fit testing is completed and tracked, etc.</p>
  </div>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Unit Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs)</h2>
    <p>Unit Safety SOPs and/or Unit RPP SOPs (also called Standard Operating Procedures) are detailed instructions pertaining to a specific unit or physical location. SOPs are written by the supervisor or RPPA and must adhere to legislation, regulations, standards, directives and orders, and to manufacturer instructions and recommendations.</p>
    <p>SOPs are posted in the workplace as a hard or soft copy.</p>
