        <p>If there are differences between standards, you must follow the one that is the most stringent and safe. Consult with the General Safety Officer, Preventive Medicine Technician (P Med Tech), RPPA or RPPC if you are not sure which standard to follow in a given situation.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of the RPP, Part II of the CLC and the accompanying Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (COHSRs) apply legally to public service employees. These regulations also apply legally to military personnel who supervise public service employees, and as a matter of CAF order to safeguard the health and safety of CAF personnel.</p>
        <p>In military operational contexts, the legislation and regulations adopted as an order to protect the CAF may not apply if there is a justifiable operational reason why applying the legislation is not possible.</p>
        <p>Reasons not to apply the RPP to military personnel are limited to hand-to-hand combat or risk of failure of a mission. Domestically, there aren’t likely to be many justifiable operational reasons that would be acceptable as a deviation from the RPP.</p>

        <p>You may need training on the listed CGSB/CSA standards to be fully aware of your responsibilities as a manager or supervisor. This falls under additional training (Step 4 on the list of training requirements at the beginning of this course).</p>

        <p>Some RPPAs are also fit testers, but not all fit testers are RPPAs. Most RPPAs are Fire Chiefs or Chief Fire Inspectors, and most fit testers are firefighters or RPPCs. Fire Chiefs have so many duties in addition to managing staff at a fire hall that they don’t typically do fit testing or air quality testing.</p>

        <p>All four types of hazardous atmospheres can be considered immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH). An IDLH atmosphere is an atmosphere that is likely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cause death, or</li>
            <li>cause immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects, or</li>
            <li>prevent or impair an individual’s ability to escape the atmosphere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An IDLH atmosphere occurs when IDLH limits for airborne contaminants are exceeded or when the atmosphere is oxygen-deficient.</p>
