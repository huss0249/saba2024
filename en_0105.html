      <p>Air and particles are inhaled through the nose and mouth. They then travel down the respiratory tract (pharynx, larynx and trachea) into the lungs via two bronchial tubes/bronchi, which lead into smaller tubes called bronchioles that end with tiny air sacs called alveoli.</p>
      <p>Particles are deposited along the respiratory tract depending on their size. Larger particles are removed in the nasal passages and smaller particles can penetrate as far as the alveoli.</p>
      <p>Very small particles can be particularly hazardous to human health because the alveoli membrane, where the oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas exchange takes place, is extremely thin.</p>
