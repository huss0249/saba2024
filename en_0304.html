<p>Identifying RPP hazards in the workplace falls under one of the 11 components of the RPP.</p>
<p>The DND RPP defines a hazardous atmosphere as any atmosphere that is oxygen-deficient, exceeds occupational exposure limits, presents a fire/explosion hazard, and/or contains an airborne toxic or disease-producing contaminant in concentrations deemed to be hazardous.</p>

    <h2>Atmospheres deficient in oxygen</h2>
    <p>Normal atmospheric air consists of:</p>

    <p>An oxygen-deficient atmosphere is a type of IDLH atmosphere that occurs when:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>the oxygen content at standard temperature and pressure has been reduced from the normal 20.95% to approximately 14%</li>
      <li>the oxygen content is normal but at altitudes above 3660 m</li>
      <li>the oxygen is <strong><a data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseDisplaced" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseDisplaced">displaced</a></strong> or <strong><a data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseConsumed" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseConsumed">consumed</a></strong></li>

    <h2>Atmospheres exceeding occupational exposure limits</h2>
    <p>An atmosphere is considered hazardous when a substance present in the atmosphere exceeds the accepted occupational exposure limits.</p>
    <p>The limits are defined in:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) list of Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for Chemical Substances, Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs) booklet</li>
      <li>the NIOSH Table of IDLH Values</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The ACGIH TLVs and BEIs</h3>
    <p>The ACGIH list of TLVs and BEIs apply to federal government personnel covered by the Canada Labour Code and are referenced in the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (COHSRs). The ACGIH booklet is updated every year and it is available for purchase on the <a href="https://www.acgih.org/" target="_blank">ACGIH website</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The threshold limit values defined in the ACGIH list of TLVs and BEIs are divided into three categories.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time-Weighted Average (TLV-TWA)</strong> under which exposure day after day for a working lifetime (over an 8-hour workday or a 40-hour workweek) would not cause adverse effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Short-Term Exposure (TLV-STEL)</strong> which is an exposure of 15 consecutive minutes that should not be exceeded at any time during the workday.</li>
      <li><strong>Ceiling Value (TLV-C)</strong> which is the concentration that should never be exceeded.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>NIOSH Table of IDLH Value</h3>
    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also analyze human and animal acute toxicity data to identify what concentration of airborne substances humans can be exposed to for 30 minutes without causing death, serious or irreversible health effects or impaired ability to escape. Details are available in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html#:~:text=IDLH%20Values%20%20%20%20Substance%20%20,%202%2C500%20ppm%20%2045%20more%20rows%20" target="_blank">NIOSH Table of IDLH Values</a>.</p>

      <h2>Atmospheres presenting a fire/explosion hazard</h2>
      
      
      <p>An explosive atmosphere is caused by the presence of an oxidant, such as the oxygen in the air, and of a combustible/flammable substance such as gas, mist, vapour, powder or dust. If there is enough of the substance mixed with the air, then a source of ignition could cause an explosion.</p>
      <p>Fire and explosions affect the human respiratory system by exposing personnel to hazardous materials present at the location of a fire or explosion. There are many hazards, but the most common ones at a location of a fire or explosion are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>formaldehyde</li>
        <li>particulate matter</li>
        <li>organic vapours/acids</li>
        <li>acrolein</li>
        <li>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</li>
        <li>carbon monoxide</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>There are two common ways of reducing the risk of serious injury or death caused by fire or explosion: preventing the release of dangerous substances and preventing sources of ignition. The success of risk reduction depends on using the correct equipment, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>respiratory protection equipment, including supplied-air options</li>
        <li>approved calibrated instruments to test and continually monitor flammable atmospheres and oxygen content</li>
        <li>explosimeters (also called combustible gas detectors) used to measure the amount of combustible gases present in a sample or a working atmosphere</li>
        <li>effective mechanical ventilation (could be non-combustible fans to expel dangerous substance levels without impacting bystanders) to quickly remove sources of ignition</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Fire and explosion are especially dangerous in confined spaces, but there are many other workplaces that can contain explosive or potentially explosive atmospheres, or that can involve activities producing such atmospheres.</p>
      
      <p>Examples of activities that can produce explosive atmospheres include paint spraying, welding, or handling fine organic dusts such as wood in carpentry shops.</p>
      
      <h3>Liquid oxygen</h3>
      <p>When it comes to compressed respirable air and oxygen requirements, liquid oxygen forms explosive mixtures with organic materials such as oil and grease. Oxygen is liquefied for more effective transport and for storage in larger volumes than is possible in gaseous forms. Gaseous oxygen is a powerful oxidizer and it can constitute a considerable fire hazard.</p>
      <p>Liquid oxygen is used in the propellant systems of missiles and rockets, and in metal works when combined with acetylene and other fuel gases for brazing, welding, and cutting of steel and other metals.</p>
    </div>
    
    
  <div>
    <h2>Atmospheres containing an airborne toxic or disease-producing contaminant</h2>
    <p>An atmosphere is considered hazardous when it contains an airborne toxic or disease-producing contaminant in concentrations deemed to be hazardous. Airborne contaminants can take the form of particulates, gases, or vapours.</p>
    
    <h3>Particulates</h3>
    <p>Particulates (sometimes called aerosols or dispersoids) are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>dusts: solid mechanically produced particles or fibres (for example asbestos, lead, etc.)</li>
      <li>mists: liquid particles in a gaseous medium</li>
      <li>fumes: solid particles generated by condensation from the gaseous state, from processes such as welding</li>
      <li>smoke: aerosols, gases, and vapours from incomplete combustion (incomplete burning of a fuel in the presence of oxygen)</li>
      <li>living organisms: airborne mold, bacteria, and viruses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Particles less than 10 microns in diameter can enter the respiratory system and particles below 5 microns in diameter can penetrate deeply into the lungs. In a healthy respiratory system, particles from 5 to 10 microns are generally expelled during breathing. However, if exposure to particulate contaminants is excessive, or if the respiratory system is diseased, the cleansing action to expel contaminants does not work.</p>

    <p>Biological effects of particulate contaminants range from minor irritation and discomfort of inert aerosols to a life-threatening damage caused by asbestos, arsenic, lead, and radioactive particulates.</p>
    
    <h3>Gases and vapours</h3>
    <p>Gases and vapours are classified according to their chemical characteristics, and they fall into the following categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>inert gases: gases that do not metabolize in the body and produce an oxygen deficiency by displacing the air (for example helium, argon, neon, etc.)</li>
      <li>acid gases: gases that are acids or produce acids when in contact with moisture (for example sulphur oxides, hydrogen chloride, etc.)</li>
      <li>alkaline gases: gases that are alkalis or produce alkalis in reaction with moisture (for example ammonia, phosphine, etc.)</li>
      <li>organic compounds: gases or vapours from organic liquids (for example acetone, toluene, etc.)</li>
      <li>organometallic compounds: gaseous or liquid substances primarily composed of carbon (for example tetraethyl lead, organic phosphates, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many gases and vapours are irritating or dangerous when inhaled. Some are hazardous or produce discomfort even in low concentrations. Exposure to low concentrations of gaseous materials can cause nausea and headaches, or it can initiate chronic disorders that can eventually be fatal.</p>
