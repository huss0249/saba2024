                <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>The RPP is the result of interconnected responsibilities. Multiple organizations, administrators, DND mployees and CAF members work together to provide respiratory protection programs.</p>
                <p>Roles and responsibilities are covered in more detail later in this module.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Management of Hazards</h2>
                <p>Respiratory hazards for an occupation are identified in the Occupational Health Workplace Assessment (OHWA) report. These reports may evaluate only respiratory health risks and controls, or they may apply more broadly to all potential health risks of an occupation.</p>
                <p>Management of hazards is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Respirator Selection</h2>
                <p>Respiratory protection devices (RPDs) must be selected based on the hazard/risk assessment of tasks as identified in an Occupational Health Workplace Assessment report.</p>
                <p>Respirator selection is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Fit Testing</h2>
                <p>At DND/CAF, fit testing is the use of quantitative (or in rare cases, qualitative) methods to evaluate the fit of
                a specific make, model, and size of respiratory protection device (RPD) on an individual. Fit testing also ensures that personnel know how to use the RPD safely.</p>
                <p>Fit testing is covered in more detail in the <strong>Using a Respiratory Protection Device</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Use of Respirators</h2>
                <p>This component of the RPP includes information on proper donning and doffing of a RPD and ensuring a proper seal of the facepiece to the skin by doing a negative/positive pressure user seal check.</p>
                <p>Use or respirators is covered in more detail in the <strong>Using a Respiratory Protection Device</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Cleaning, Inspection, Maintenance and Storage</h2>
                <p>This component of the RPP includes information on cleaning, sanitizing, inspecting, repairing (when possible), and disposing (life-cycling) of RPDs and their components.</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Using a Respiratory Protection Device</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Compressed Breathing Air and Systems</h2>
                <p>This component of the RPP describes the requirements for compressed breathing air systems used to provide air to supplied air respirators (SARs).</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Compressed Breathing Air Quality</h2>
                <p>Compressed breathing air quality testing is performed at least every six months to ensure that the standards for safe breathing air are being met.</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Health Surveillance</h2>
                <p>This component of the RPP covers pre-placement and periodic health evaluations to ensure that users are fit to wear RPDs safely before being assigned tasks that require the use of RPDs. These health evaluations also ensure that each user is able to wear an RPD safely over time.</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Training</h2>
                <p>This component of the RPP ensures that everyone involved in the use of RPDs, including RPD users, their managers and supervisors, Respiratory Protection Program Administrators/Coordinators, Fit Testers, etc., gets proper training.</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Program Evaluation</h2>
                <p>Program evaluation ensures compliance with the RPP through various audits and reviews.</p>
                <p>This topic is covered in more detail in the <strong>Respiratory Protection Program for Managers and Supervisors</strong> course.</p>
