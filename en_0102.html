        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>If mechanical ventilation is inadequate, mechanics can be exposed to hazardous airborne dust particles (for
          example asbestos, lead, etc.), vapours or fumes (from coatings and residues on metal being welded, for example
          isocyanates), and polluted air.</p>

        <p>The following image shows a DND mechanic wearing a reusable elastomeric respirator to mitigate the
          respiratory risks.</p>

<h2>Hazardous substances</h2>
<p>Examples of exposure to hazardous substances associated with work include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>beryllium metal and alloys</li>
  <li>asbestos</li>
</ul>

<tdd-instruction>Select each hazardous substance for details.</tdd-instruction>

        <h2>Beryllium metal and alloys</h2>
        <p>Beryllium metal and alloys are used in manufacturing of aircrafts and missiles. Beryllium dust, mist, vapour
          or fumes can cause a chronic respiratory disorder called berylliosis which affects the lungs, organs, nervous
          system, and lymphatic system, and which can lead to cancer and death.</p>

        <p>Respiratory disorders have also been observed in family members of workers exposed to beryllium, especially
          those who may have come into contact with dusty clothing.</p>

        <p>So not only is it important to make sure that workers aren't inhaling beryllium, but also that they are not
          bringing it home to others on clothing, hair, shoes, etc</p>

        <h2>Asbestos</h2>

        <p>Asbestos, if not managed by an effective asbestos management program, can become airborne during removal,
          repairs, alterations or maintenance of any building, facility or vehicles that contain asbestos. Typically,
          older infrastructure built before the 1970s has asbestos in pipes, ceiling tiles, insulation, flooring, and
          paint, but it can also be present in brake pads of vehicles, etc.</p>

        <p>Without proper respiratory protection and practices, personnel involved in construction work, ship building,
          maintenance, painting, welding, and refinishing, or any other type of vehicle maintenance, are all at risk of
          inhaling asbestos.</p>

        <p>Latent effects are typical of asbestos-related cancers. Asbestos inhalation can also lead to plaque in the
          lining of the lungs, fluid around the lungs, scarring of the lung tissue (lung fibrosis), and mesothelioma (a
          rare cancer that forms in the thin lining that surrounds the lungs). All these effects can make it difficult
          or impossible to breathe, immediately or over time.</p>
